For my idea 2 for the mini project, I wanted to have a message pop-up when the mouse hovers over the screen. Big letters will 
fade up that say "happy birthday" and confette would pop-out from the left and right sides. This will be the animated part in 
this project. The mouse hovering over the screen will activate this animation and that will be the user interactivity part. 
Then for the sound requirement, a party popper/crowd yelling sound will play.
