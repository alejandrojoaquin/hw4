For my mini project for CP 1, I want to make a program where one switch is placed in the middle of the screen. Two titles of 
songs are on either side, parrallel to the switch. When switched to one side it plays a song. When switched to the other side 
it plays another song that has sampled the previous track. The animation requirement will come from flipping the switch on and 
off. The user interactivity requirement will come from the clicking the switch to activate the switch animation. And the 
requirement of sound will be the two songs that play when you flip to one side.
